# Unit Economics Autopsy

## Business Context
A fast-growing on-demand services platform is experiencing strong revenue and user growth, yet profitability has been declining over recent months. Leadership suspects that growth may be masking structural cost issues, inefficient customer acquisition, or loss-making customer segments.

This project simulates the role of a data analyst tasked with diagnosing the underlying drivers of declining unit economics and providing data-backed recommendations to restore sustainable profitability.

## Problem Statement
Despite increasing order volume and gross revenue, the company’s contribution margin has deteriorated. The key challenge is to identify where value is being created versus destroyed across customers, services, regions, and acquisition channels.

## Key Business Questions
- Where are we losing money at the unit level?
- Which customer segments are profitable vs loss-making?
- Are certain acquisition channels driving low-quality growth?
- How does customer lifetime value evolve across cohorts?
- What operational or pricing levers could improve profitability?

## Data Overview
The analysis is based on synthetic but realistic datasets representing:
- Customer profiles and acquisition channels
- Orders and revenue
- Variable, delivery, and support costs
- Marketing spend
- Customer support interactions

The dataset structure mirrors what would typically be available in a real on-demand services business.

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and validated analytical datasets
- SQL-based unit economics and cohort analysis
- CAC and LTV evaluation by acquisition channel
- Segment-level profitability diagnostics
- Scenario modeling for strategic decision-making
- Interactive dashboard for stakeholder consumption
- Executive summary with actionable recommendations
